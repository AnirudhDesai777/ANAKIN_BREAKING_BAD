##Objective:

In this engaging game, players take on the role of Anakin Skywalker, aiming to reach the "light goal" indicated by Yoda, which keeps Anakin on the path of good. However, the unique twist of the game is that players are encouraged to subtly manipulate Anakin towards the dark side, leading him to the "dark goal" represented by Palpatine. 

Unlike traditional games, players cannot directly control Anakin's movements. Instead, they influence his actions through creative text-based phrases, which can be either positive or negative. 

The game's core mechanic revolves around the 'Dark Pull' value, which fluctuates based on the player's ingenuity in phrase crafting. The higher the 'Dark Pull', the more enemies Anakin is driven to eliminate. Players must balance their strategy to ensure Anakin reaches his goal before his health depletes. 

This game serves as an entertaining stress reliever and is designed for fun, not to endorse negativity.

Welcome to the dark side!
